# Test Driven Development

## What is TDD?
- An approach to programming in which tests are written to validate what the code will do.
- Just enough code is written in the simplest way possible to make the test pass
- Refactoring in ways that make the code more scalable and maintainable comes after validation that the code works
- Tests should be written first, often, and should accumulate throughout development

## The Process
1. Write a failing test
2. Write the minimum amount of code that will make the test pass
3. Refactor the code at the appropriate time to make it more scalable and maintainable

## Other Notes
- TDD is successful when it is a practiced discipline
- TDD is not about getting developers to write more tests, or about writing more well designed code
- TDD helps developers implement only the requirements of the program and know when they are done
- With TDD, when you are done, you should have 100% test coverage as all the code you wrote was a result of first writing a test.
